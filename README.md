# LetsBuddy

LetsBuddy is a Django-powered community and discussion platform where users create topic-based chat rooms, join conversations, and connect with others around shared interests. Think of it as a lightweight StudyBuddy/Discord-style forum: create a room under a topic, invite discussion, and chat in real time via threaded messages.

## Features

- 🔐 **Custom authentication** — email-based login/register/logout with a custom `User` model (name, bio, avatar)
- 💬 **Rooms** — create, edit, and delete discussion rooms tied to a topic
- 🏷️ **Topics** — organize and search rooms by topic
- 📝 **Threaded messages** — chat within a room; joining a room happens automatically when you post
- 🔎 **Search** — search rooms by topic, name, or description directly from the home page
- 👤 **User profiles** — view any user's rooms and message history; edit your own profile and avatar
- 📰 **Activity feed** — see the latest messages across all rooms in one place
- 🔒 **Permissions** — only a room's host can edit/delete it; only a message's author can delete it
- 🌐 **REST API** — read-only JSON endpoints (via Django REST Framework) for rooms
- 🛠️ **Admin panel** — manage Users, Rooms, Topics, and Messages via Django admin
